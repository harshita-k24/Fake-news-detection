# Fake-news-detection
Fake news spreads quickly on the internet and can cause serious problems. It can confuse people, create panic, or spread lies. A Machine Learning project in Python can help solve this issue. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we can build a model that reads the news headline or article and predicts if it’s real or fake. This project helps people and media companies check information before trusting it.

Today, we learned to detect fake news with Python. We took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialised a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. We ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.82% in magnitude.

This project is very useful in today’s digital world. You can also make a simple website using Flask where users paste a news headline and see if it’s fake or not. It’s a practical and timely project to learn NLP, text classification, and real-world machine learning. Plus, it helps make the internet a safer place for information sharing.

Hope you enjoyed the fake news detection Python project. Keep visiting DataFlair for more interesting Python, data science, and machine learning projects.
